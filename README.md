# Polynomial-Curve-fitting-using-Regression
This repository contains the implementation of polynomial curve fitting using a regression model.

The file Curve Fitting.pdf is the pdf version of the python notebook which contains the code to fit a polynomial curve through data points in 2-D space.

The entire flow of the implemented follows 3 steps:
(1) Identifying an optimal degree for the polynomial using the validation set
(2) Fitting the model (with selected degree) using the training and validation data and printing the training and test errors
(3) Plotting the polynomial function that was fitted
